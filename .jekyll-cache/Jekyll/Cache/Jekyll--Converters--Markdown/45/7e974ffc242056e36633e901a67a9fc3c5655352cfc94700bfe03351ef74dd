I"^<p>Here I would like to argue for a style of code I have come to like. There are a few phrases I associate with it.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Using sane defaults</li>
  <li>Write your code so that it is always true.</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_object_pattern#JavaScript">Null object pattern</a></li>
