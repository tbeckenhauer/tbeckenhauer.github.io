I thought I might share with others how I am learning Spanish as it seems to be moderately effective.

First a little bit of background. I took Spanish in high school but never did too well with it.  I decided I would like to change that.  I don't know too many people that speak Spanish, so that will be a challenge.

For starters, I use Duolingo, this is my primary means of learning new words.  I understand that tools like this have limited use, but they do have use. I need a way to get my feet wet with new Spanish words, and Duolingo has been good for that.

Second I attempt to move as many activities to Spanish as possible.

* Watch the news in Spanish, with subtitles on.

* Change my phone language settings to Spanish.  Side note on this.  My phone is an Android, after I changed my phone to Spanish, all my installs of Chrome seem to have picked up Spanish as my preferred language.

* Watch programing videos in Spanish with subtitles on.

* I attend Catholic mass in Spanish.

* Attend the local Spanish speakers meetup group.

* If I need to email co-workers that speak Spanish, I take the time to write it out in Spanish, go back and forth with it in Google translate, and end up having a copy in English and Spanish.

I feel the language starting to click, but it's still not there.  Why not write this post in Spanish?  Well I should, but I should also get some rest, so I think that is it for today.  Maybe the next one.
