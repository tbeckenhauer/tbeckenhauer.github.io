## Deep Dive into Exception Handling: From Vue3 Frontend to Kotlin Backend

In our [previous post](link-to-previous-post), we discussed the basics of "Tunneling Input Exceptions to Output Exceptions." Today, we're diving deeper by examining a real-world application flow. We'll start with object verification on the frontend using Vue3 and Vuex, and then work our way to the backend using Kotlin with Spring Boot.

### Domain Objects

Let's first define our domain objects:

1. **Person**:
   - `name`: String
   - `age`: Integer
   - `email`: String

2. **Store Location**:
   - `address`: String
   - `city`: String
   - `postalCode`: String

3. **Transaction**:
   - `id`: UUID
   - `person`: Person
   - `storeLocation`: Store Location
   - `amount`: Double

4. **Transaction Log**:
   - `transaction`: Transaction
   - `timestamp`: DateTime
   - `status`: Enum (SUCCESS, FAILED, PENDING)

### Vue3 Frontend: Input Verification and Exception Handling

In Vue3 with Vuex, input verification can be neatly implemented using computed properties and methods. For our `Person` object, here's a simplified component:

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <input v-model="person.name" @input="verifyName" />
    <!-- ... other input fields ... -->
    <button @click="processTransaction">Submit</button>
  </div>
</template>

<script>
import { ref, computed } from 'vue'
import { useStore } from 'vuex'

export default {
  setup() {
    const store = useStore()
    const person = ref({
      name: '',
      // ... other properties ...
    })

    function verifyName() {
      if (!person.name || person.name.length < 3) {
        throw new Error('Invalid name.')
      }
      // ... other verifications ...
    }

    function processTransaction() {
      try {
        // ... business logic ...
        store.dispatch('submitTransaction', person.value)
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Transaction failed:', error)
      }
    }

    return { person, verifyName, processTransaction }
  }
}
</script>
```

When a user inputs data, we verify it immediately. If any verification fails, we throw an exception. When attempting to process the transaction, we handle both our "happy path" (successful transaction) and our "sad path" (an error occurred).

### Kotlin Backend: Handling and Tunneling

Once our data reaches the Kotlin/Spring Boot backend, we must again verify the input. If any object doesn't match our expectations, we throw an exception, handle it with some business logic, and return the appropriate response to the frontend.

```kotlin
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/transactions")
class TransactionController(private val transactionService: TransactionService) {

    @PostMapping
    fun createTransaction(@RequestBody transaction: Transaction): ResponseEntity<Any> {
        return try {
            validateTransaction(transaction)
            transactionService.processTransaction(transaction)
            ResponseEntity.ok().build()
        } catch (ex: InvalidTransactionException) {
            ResponseEntity.badRequest().body(ex.message)
        }
    }

    private fun validateTransaction(transaction: Transaction) {
        if (transaction.person.name.length < 3) {
            throw InvalidTransactionException("Invalid name.")
        }
        // ... other validations ...
    }
}

class InvalidTransactionException(msg: String) : RuntimeException(msg)
```

### Database Logic: More of the Same

In your database access layer (perhaps using Spring Data JPA), you'll want to again ensure the integrity of the data. Whether you're reading from or writing to the database, validation is crucial. If an error occurs at this level, throw a specific exception which can be caught and handled by your service or controller layer, ultimately ensuring the frontend receives a meaningful error message.

**Conclusion**

Throughout the tech stack, from Vue3 on the frontend to Kotlin and Spring Boot on the backend, the principle of exception tunneling remains consistent: Validate inputs early and often, throw exceptions where something is amiss, and handle exceptions gracefully to keep the user informed. With diligent design, you can ensure robust and user-friendly application behavior across the board.

This is a generalized overview. In a real-world application, you'd likely have more sophisticated validation rules, more intricate business logic, and a more detailed error handling strategy. Adjust and expand upon this post as needed to suit your specific needs or platform.
