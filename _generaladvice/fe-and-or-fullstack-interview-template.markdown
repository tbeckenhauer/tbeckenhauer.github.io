## Introduction

When it comes to hiring, identifying the right candidate for a frontend and/or full stack developer position is not an easy task. As hiring managers and panel developers, our goal is to evaluate candidates based on their proficiency and excellence in their chosen technologies, whether that's Vue.js, Angular, React, Svelte, or Kotlin Spring Boot. The focus here is not on the tools themselves but on the craftspeople who wield them.

This blog post aims to provide a comprehensive interview template designed for these roles, delineating three crucial stages of the hiring process: Screening, Culture Fit/HR round, and the Technical Panel.

## Screening

The screening stage is where we gauge the candidate's basic skills and understanding of their chosen tech stack. Here are ten sample questions for this stage:

1. What projects have you worked on recently?
2. How comfortable are you with modern JavaScript (ES6 and beyond)?
3. What kind of development environment are you comfortable with?
4. How do you approach testing in your projects?
5. Can you explain the concept of state management?
6. How would you tackle performance issues in a web app?
7. What is your experience with responsive design?
8. How familiar are you with version control systems, particularly Git?
9. Have you worked in an Agile development environment?
10. How do you handle debugging in your code?

## Technical Panel

Instead of surprising candidates with trick questions, we find it more effective to present them with a list of questions and ask them to answer as many as possible. This approach offers a better measure of their knowledge and how they apply it. Two excellent repositories for these questions are:

- [Front-end Developer Interview Questions](https://github.com/h5bp/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions) for frontend-related queries.
- [Back-End Developer Interview Questions](https://github.com/arialdomartini/Back-End-Developer-Interview-Questions#db-migrations) for backend-related queries.

A live coding challenge forms a crucial part of this round. The candidate should create a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application on their computer. The main focus here is to observe their problem-solving approach, code structuring, and adherence to best practices. For frontend roles, the application should store data to local storage, while full-stack roles should store to a database.

## Culture Fit/HR Round

This stage is crucial in assessing whether the candidate will fit into your company's culture and work well with existing team members. Here are ten sample questions for this round:

1. Can you describe a situation where you worked under pressure or had to meet a tight deadline?
2. How do you handle feedback and criticism regarding your work?
3. What interests you about our company?
4. Can you give us an example of a conflict you had in your previous work and how you handled it?
5. What kind of work environment suits you best?
6. What motivates you in your work?
7. How do you balance work with your personal life?
8. Tell us about a time you had to learn a new skill or technology for a project. How did you go about it?
9. How have you handled a situation where you didn't agree with your supervisor or team's decision?
10. What is your approach to continuous learning and professional development?

By following this structured approach, hiring managers and panel developers can better assess candidates, not only for their technical skills but also for their fit in the company culture. This holistic evaluation can lead to more successful hiring decisions.
