Interview Template for Frontend and Full Stack Candidates
=========================================================

Hello everyone! Today, we are focusing on how to structure an interview process for Frontend and Full Stack developer roles. Instead of limiting our search to Vue.js or Kotlin Spring Boot developers, we'll be targeting candidates with expertise in their chosen technologies. Our goal is to identify candidates who excel in their respective fields, whether that be React, Angular, Vue.js, Svelte, or Kotlin Spring Boot.

Interview Guidance for Hiring Managers
--------------------------------------

When hiring for developer roles, it's crucial to assess a candidate's technical proficiency, problem-solving skills, cultural fit, and potential for growth. Here's a general layout for a three-round interview process:

### Round 1: Screening

This preliminary interview is usually a call or video conference with the candidate to gauge their communication skills, motivation, and high-level understanding of their chosen technology stack.

**Suggested Questions:**

*   Can you explain your previous experience with your chosen technology stack?
*   What motivates you to work as a Frontend/Full Stack developer?
*   Can you explain a challenging problem you've encountered in your previous projects and how you overcame it?

### Round 2: Technical Evaluation

The primary goal of this round is to evaluate the candidate's depth of knowledge in their chosen technology stack. Instead of trick questions, we provide the candidate with a list of questions in advance and ask them to answer as many as they can.

You can find a comprehensive list of frontend questions on [GitHub](https://github.com/h5bp/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions). For Backend, here is a [similar list](https://github.com/arialdomartini/Back-End-Developer-Interview-Questions#db-migrations). The focus should be on core concepts, problem-solving, and experience with common tools and practices in Spring Boot development.

### Round 3: Cultural Fit / HR

This round assesses the candidate's cultural fit within the organization, their interpersonal skills, and their alignment with your company's values and mission.

**Suggested Questions:**

*   Can you describe a situation where you had to work as part of a team to solve a problem?
*   How do you handle feedback and criticism?
*   What are your career goals and how do you think this role aligns with them?

Interview Guidance for Panel Developers
---------------------------------------

As a developer on an interview panel, your role is to dive deep into the candidate's technical skills. Ask detailed questions about their chosen technology stack, previous projects, and how they solve problems. Instead of looking for specific technology knowledge, assess their understanding of key programming concepts, problem-solving abilities, and willingness to learn and adapt.

Remember, the purpose of these interviews is not just to evaluate a candidate's current skills but to identify their potential for growth, their problem-solving capabilities, and their fit within your team. With these guidelines, we hope you'll find your next Frontend or Full Stack superstar. Happy interviewing!
