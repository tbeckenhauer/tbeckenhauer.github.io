- Don't put it in a code block, just do regular markdown.

I need you to write a new blog post for me.
- Include estimated reading time.
- I would like to detail an interview template for internal and external candidates for frontend VueJS and/or full stack VueJS & Kotlin springboot candidates.  
- This should detail guidance for hiring managers and panel developers.  
- The interview template rather than filter for candidates that only know these technologies, I would rather filter for candidates that are excellent at their chosen technologies. So rather than focus on only VueJS candidates(which is a smaller talent pool) I would like to focus on candidates that have experience with Angular, React, VueJs, or Svelte and take the candidates that's best at their chosen technology.
- For the technical screening, Instead of trying to surprise the candidate with trick questions, I "present the candidate with a list of questions" and ask them to quickly answer as many as possible. In the past I have used https://github.com/h5bp/Front-end-Developer-Interview-Questions
- Let's use a similar philosophy with spring boot stuff.
- For the Culture Fit/HR round
 - Give me 10 tricky, but not obviously tricky culture fit/HR interview questions.
