In the world of software development, we often find ourselves grappling with the decision of how to prioritize our coding process. Should we first get our code to run efficiently, or should we focus on just getting it to run? This common dilemma brings us to a classic piece of advice: _Make it Work, then Well, then Fast_.

Let's break down this timeless principle.

## 1. **Make it "Work"**

### Understanding the Principle:

This is the basic foundation of any software - its functionality. Before anything else, the software needs to perform its primary task. No matter how efficient or elegant the code is, if it doesn't work, it's of no use.

### Why is this Important?

- **Clarity of Purpose**: Focusing on making it work ensures you understand the problem clearly and can find a solution to it.
  
- **Momentum**: Once you have a working version, it gives you the momentum and motivation to refine and improve it.

## 2. **Make it "Work Well"**

### Understanding the Principle:

Once the software is functional, the next step is to refine it. This means cleaning up the code, making it more readable, modular, and maintainable. This phase often involves refactoring.

### Why is this Important?

- **Long-term Maintenance**: Clean and modular code is easier to maintain and update. This saves time and resources in the long run.

- **Collaboration**: Well-structured code is easier for other developers to understand and contribute to.

## 3. **Make it "Work Fast"**

### Understanding the Principle:

Now that you have functional and clean code, it's time to optimize. This phase is about making your software efficient, reducing its runtime, and making it more responsive.

### Why is this Important?

- **User Experience**: Faster software provides a better user experience. Speed can often be a decisive factor in user retention.

- **Resource Optimization**: Efficient software can save costs in terms of server resources and energy consumption.

## **Conclusion**

While it's tempting to jump straight into optimization or spend hours perfecting code that hasn't been tested yet, following the _Make it Work, then Well, then Fast_ principle ensures a balanced and effective approach to software development. 

Remember, a super-fast application that doesn't function as intended isn't valuable. Likewise, a working application that's written haphazardly can become a nightmare to maintain. This methodology helps strike the right balance between functionality, cleanliness, and performance.
