This is going to be a short post since I will leave further in detail discussion on the specifics to the posts on the specific recommendations.  To me this is an important life principal, but I have also found it to be an important strategy for developing and maintaining code.

There is nothing revolutionary about this.  But I don't see enough developers paying attention to how they sort their code for readability.

1. [Ordering of words in a function/variable name.](/naming-conventions/)
2. [Ordering of declaration/calling of functions in a class definition.](/ordering-the-functions-in-your-class/)
3. [When Validating Inputs](/when-validating-inputs/)
3. Choosing the most important tickets to get done in a sprint.
