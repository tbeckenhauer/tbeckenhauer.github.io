Certainly, migrating a Tomcat-based Java servlet application to a Spring Boot application involves several steps, including directory structure changes, build script modifications (like Maven's `pom.xml`), and configuration updates. This script will primarily focus on copying relevant files from the Tomcat application to a new Spring Boot structure. Here's how you might structure a script for this:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Function to migrate a Tomcat servlet application to a Spring Boot structure
scan_and_migrate() {
  # Paths to the source Tomcat servlet and destination Spring Boot webapp directories
  tomcat_app_path="$1"
  springboot_app_path="$2"

  # Check if paths are not empty
  if [[ -z "$tomcat_app_path" || -z "$springboot_app_path" ]]; then
    echo "Error: Paths to Tomcat servlet and Spring Boot webapp are required."
    exit 1
  fi

  # Check if paths are valid
  if [[ ! -d "$tomcat_app_path" || ! -d "$springboot_app_path" ]]; then
    echo "Error: Both paths must be directories."
    exit 1
  fi

  # Define the main directories for the source and destination
  src_main="${tomcat_app_path}/src/main"
  dest_main="${springboot_app_path}/src/main"

  # Create necessary directories in the Spring Boot application if they don't exist
  mkdir -p "${dest_main}/java"
  mkdir -p "${dest_main}/resources"

  # Copy the application source files to the Spring Boot structure
  if [[ -d "${src_main}/java" ]]; then
    cp -R "${src_main}/java/"* "${dest_main}/java/"
  fi

  # Copy the resources (like application.properties or application.yml)
  if [[ -d "${src_main}/resources" ]]; then
    cp -R "${src_main}/resources/"* "${dest_main}/resources/"
  fi

  # If the Tomcat app uses web.xml, it needs to be converted to Spring Boot configurations.
  if [[ -f "${src_main}/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml" ]]; then
    echo "A web.xml file was found. Manual conversion to Spring Boot configurations is required."
    # Copy web.xml to the Spring Boot directory for reference
    cp "${src_main}/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml" "${springboot_app_path}/web.xml.reference"
  fi

  echo "Migration of files completed. Please check the configurations and update build scripts accordingly."
}

# Usage: scan_and_migrate "/path/to/tomcat/app" "/path/to/springboot/app"
```

**Explanation**:
- This script sets up the required standard directory structure for a Spring Boot application, which follows the Maven standard directory layout.
- It then copies over the Java source files and resources from the Tomcat application to the appropriate Spring Boot directories.
- If a `web.xml` file is present (common in traditional servlet applications), it notifies the user that manual intervention is required to convert these configurations, as Spring Boot doesn't use `web.xml` for its configurations. It copies this file as a reference to the Spring Boot directory.

**Please note**: This script assumes a certain directory structure based on Maven standards. If your Tomcat app has a different structure, you'll need to adjust the script. Also, it doesn't handle more complex migrations (like updating build scripts, dependencies, or converting `web.xml` configurations to Spring Boot), which often require careful manual conversion and verification. Always make sure to back up your applications before running scripts like this.
