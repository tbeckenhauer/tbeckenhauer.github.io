This post will be short, as I will leave further detailed discussion herein; focusing on the specific recommendation(s) within each narrowly-scoped post.  To me, this is an important life principle, but I've also found it to be an important strategy for developing and maintaining code.

There is nothing revolutionary about this, yet I don't see enough developers paying attention to how they sort their code for readability.

1. [Ordering of words in a function/variable name.](/naming-conventions/)
2. [Ordering of declaration/calling of functions in a class definition.](/ordering-the-functions-in-your-class/)
3. [When Validating Inputs](/when-validating-inputs/)
3. Choosing the most important tickets to get done in a sprint.
