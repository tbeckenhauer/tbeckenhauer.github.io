 Just a thing to be careful with.

## Summary
If you are using for...in you might need to add in a .hasOwnProperty() check, or you might rather use for...of.

## Details
Way back in the day all we had was for...in, and it was tricky. It could "[iterate over the enumerable properties of an object, in an arbitrary order](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of#difference_between_for...of_and_for...in)".  Let's unpack that a little bit. 
Objects: That means it can iterate over Strings, Functions, Date, RegExp, Arrays, and more.  In my testing, wondering if I could get anything out of Dates and RegExp, I couldn't.  Why is that?

```javascript
for (var x in new Date()) {
  console.log(x)
}
undefined
```
It has properties, but not any enumerable properties.

```javascript
var y2k = new Date(2000, 0, 1);
y2k.disaster = true;
for (var x in y2k) {
  console.log(x);
}
"disaster"
```

Let's build out something more elaborate.
```javascript
var GenericDisaster = { doZombiesShowUp: undefined, doAliensShowUp: undefined }
function Y2K() {
    this.date = new Date(2000, 0, 1);
}
function Y2K() {
    this.date = new Date(2000, 0, 1);
    this.countriesThatPrepared = ['USA', 'UK', 'Canada', 'Australia']; //Nothing to see here, move along.
    this.didBadStuffHappen = 'not really'
    //Sorry, I just listened to the 'You're Wrong About' episode on this.
}
Y2K.prototype = GenericDisaster;
var y2k = new Y2K();
for(var x in y2k) {
    console.log(x);
}
> date
> countriesThatPrepared
> didBadStuffHappen
> doZombiesShowUp
> doAliensShowUp
```
So we end up looping over all this stuff from 'GenericDisaster' that we may not have wanted. Easy fix for that, even if it's a little ugly, is to use .hasOwnProperty()

```javascript
for(var x in y2k) {
  if(y2k.hasOwnProperty(x)) { 
    console.log(x);
  }
}
> date
> countriesThatPrepared
> didBadStuffHappen
```

Boom. Easy. Oh wait, order isn't guaranteed.

Obviously more to talk about, but that's enough for now.
